# Bellybutton Biodiversity

In this project I developed a webpage with HTML and JavaScript. The page is extracting data from a bellybutton dateset to display plots on sample value by OTU ID (bacteria ID). There are two graphoc representation, a horizontal bar graoph that only shows the top 10 bacteria and its sample value; the bubble chart on the bottom shows all the bacteria and the size of the bubbles is colletalet to the sample size as well as the color bein correlated to its otu_label. 

There is an additional plot that represent the wash frequency of the belly button.

Further exploration could look for association between bacteria and a demographic trait like age or race. 

I hope you enjoy it!
